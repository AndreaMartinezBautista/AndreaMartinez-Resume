        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Andrea Martinez-Bautista and here is a brief overview of my resume. In this resume I will be talking about my experiences, work, and personal achievements that I have achieved during my years in the University of California, Riverside. However, in this introduction I will talk about my work and college experiences in detail to further illustrate my gains, setbacks, and goals.
<br><br>

        To begin, before entering college as a college freshman I had worked as a receptionist, cashier, and assistant in an automotive shop called Martin's Automotive. This allowed me to gain several skills such as, social skills, management skills, and hands on experience. After my automotive job I moved to Riverside to attend the University of California, Riverside to continue my education. In my Freshman year of college in 2021 I started to work in a boba shop called 7 Leaves. Unfortunately I had to quit this job in order to focus more on my school work and bring attention to classes that I was lacking in. Such classes included Math 009A which was crucial to my major requirement and needed to be completed in order to pass onto Math 009B. Without being able to pass my math course I would not be able to advance and take my upper division courses such as Microeconomic Theory, Microeconomic Theory, and other related courses towards my academic career.
<br><br>

        So, during my second year in the University of California, Riverside I had to quit working and focus on my academic studies to pursue my career and academic studies. I took advantage of the Universities services such as the ARC which specialized in tutoring and other services that help students succeed in college. I took advantage of this resource center because during my second year of college (as stated above), in fall quarter, I struggled in a class that ended up affecting my overall gpa. I knew this had to change so that is why I chose to quit my job and use the ARC to further focus on my priorities. Aside from quitting my job, I plan to work once again during the fall quarter of 2023 and join on-campus clubs and/or organizations that will help me gain more work and social skills. Especially applying to internships during this time so I can start advancing further into my career.
